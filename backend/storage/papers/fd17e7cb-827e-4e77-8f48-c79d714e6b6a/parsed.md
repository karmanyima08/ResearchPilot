## Abstract

The use of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to retrieve relevant information from an external knowledge source enables large language models (LLMs) to answer questions over private and/or previously unseen document collections. However, RAG fails on global questions directed at an entire text corpus, such as 'What are the main themes in the dataset?', since this is inherently a queryfocused summarization (QFS) task, rather than an explicit retrieval task. Prior QFS methods, meanwhile, do not scale to the quantities of text indexed by typical RAG systems. To combine the strengths of these contrasting methods, we propose GraphRAG , a graph-based approach to question answering over private text corpora that scales with both the generality of user questions and the quantity of source text. Our approach uses an LLM to build a graph index in two stages: first, to derive an entity knowledge graph from the source documents, then to pregenerate community summaries for all groups of closely related entities. Given a question, each community summary is used to generate a partial response, before all partial responses are again summarized in a final response to the user. For a class of global sensemaking questions over datasets in the 1 million token range, we show that GraphRAG leads to substantial improvements over a conventional RAGbaseline for both the comprehensiveness and diversity of generated answers.

## 1 Introduction

Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) (Lewis et al., 2020) is an established approach to using LLMs to answer queries based on data that is too large to contain in a language model's context window , meaning the maximum number of tokens (units of text) that can be processed by the LLM at once (Kuratov et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2023). In the canonical RAG setup, the system has access to a large external corpus of text records and retrieves a subset of records that are individually relevant to the query and collectively small enough to fit into the context window of the LLM. The LLM then

generates a response based on both the query and the retrieved records (Baumel et al., 2018; Dang, 2006; Laskar et al., 2020; Yao et al., 2017). This conventional approach, which we collectively call vector RAG , works well for queries that can be answered with information localized within a small set of records. However, vector RAG approaches do not support sensemaking queries, meaning queries that require global understanding of the entire dataset, such as ' What are the key trends in how scientific discoveries are influenced by interdisciplinary research over the past decade? '

Sensemaking tasks require reasoning over ' connections (which can be among people, places, and events) in order to anticipate their trajectories and act effectively ' (Klein et al., 2006). LLMs such as GPT (Achiam et al., 2023; Brown et al., 2020), Llama (Touvron et al., 2023), and Gemini (Anil et al., 2023) excel at sensemaking in complex domains like scientific discovery (Microsoft, 2023) and intelligence analysis (Ranade and Joshi, 2023). Given a sensemaking query and a text with an implicit and interconnected set of concepts, an LLM can generate a summary that answers the query. The challenge, however, arises when the volume of data requires a RAG approach, since vector RAG approaches are unable to support sensemaking over an entire corpus.

In this paper, we present GraphRAG - a graph-based RAG approach that enables sensemaking over the entirety of a large text corpus. GraphRAG first uses an LLM to construct a knowledge graph, where nodes correspond to key entities in the corpus and edges represent relationships between those entities. Next, it partitions the graph into a hierarchy of communities of closely related entities, before using an LLM to generate community-level summaries. These summaries are generated in a bottom-up manner following the hierarchical structure of extracted communities, with summaries at higher levels of the hierarchy recursively incorporating lower-level summaries. Together, these community summaries provide global descriptions and insights over the corpus. Finally, GraphRAG answers queries through map-reduce processing of community summaries; in the map step, the summaries are used to provide partial answers to the query independently and in parallel, then in the reduce step, the partial answers are combined and used to generate a final global answer.

The GraphRAG method and its ability to perform global sensemaking over an entire corpus form the main contribution of this work. To demonstrate this ability, we developed a novel application of the LLM-as-a-judge technique (Zheng et al., 2024) suitable for questions targeting broad issues and themes where there is no ground-truth answer. This approach first uses one LLM to generate a diverse set of global sensemaking questions based on corpus-specific use cases, before using a second LLM to judge the answers of two different RAG systems using predefined criteria (defined in Section 3.3). We use this approach to compare GraphRAG to vector RAG on two representative real-world text datasets. Results show GraphRAG strongly outperforms vector RAG when using GPT-4 as the LLM.

GraphRAG is available as open-source software at https://github . com/microsoft/graphrag. In addition, versions of the GraphRAG approach are also available as extensions to multiple opensource libraries, including LangChain (LangChain, 2024), LlamaIndex (LlamaIndex, 2024), NebulaGraph (NebulaGraph, 2024), and Neo4J (Neo4J, 2024).

## 2 Background

## 2.1 RAG Approaches and Systems

RAG generally refers to any system where a user query is used to retrieve relevant information from external data sources, whereupon this information is incorporated into the generation of a response to the query by an LLM (or other generative AI model, such as a multi-media model). The query and retrieved records populate a prompt template, which is then passed to the LLM (Ram et al., 2023). RAG is ideal when the total number of records in a data source is too large to include in a single prompt to the LLM, i.e. the amount of text in the data source exceeds the LLM's context window.

In canonical RAG approaches, the retrieval process returns a set number of records that are semantically similar to the query and the generated answer uses only the information in those retrieved records. A common approach to conventional RAG is to use text embeddings, retrieving records closest to the query in vector space where closeness corresponds to semantic similarity (Gao et al., 2023). While some RAG approaches may use alternative retrieval mechanisms, we collectively refer to the family of conventional approaches as vector RAG . GraphRAG contrasts with vector RAG in its ability to answer queries that require global sensemaking over the entire data corpus.

GraphRAG builds upon prior work on advanced RAG strategies. GraphRAG leverages summaries over large sections of the data source as a form of 'self-memory' (described in Cheng et al. 2024), which are later used to answer queries as in Mao et al. 2020). These summaries are generated in parallel and iteratively aggregated into global summaries, similar to prior techniques (Feng et al., 2023; Gao et al., 2023; Khattab et al., 2022; Shao et al., 2023; Su et al., 2020; Trivedi et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2024). In particular, GraphRAG is similar to other approaches that use hierarchical indexing to create summaries (similar to Kim et al. 2023; Sarthi et al. 2024). GraphRAG contrasts with these approaches by generating a graph index from the source data, then applying graph-based community detection to create a thematic partitioning of the data.

## 2.2 Using Knowledge Graphs with LLMs and RAG

Approaches to knowledge graph extraction from natural language text corpora include rulematching, statistical pattern recognition, clustering, and embeddings (Etzioni et al., 2004; Kim et al., 2016; Mooney and Bunescu, 2005; Yates et al., 2007). GraphRAG falls into a more recent body of research that use of LLMs for knowledge graph extraction (Ban et al., 2023; Melnyk et al., 2022; OpenAI, 2023; Tan et al., 2017; Trajanoska et al., 2023; Yao et al., 2023; Yates et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2024a). It also adds to a growing body of RAG approaches that use a knowledge graph as an index (Gao et al., 2023). Some techniques use subgraphs, elements of the graph, or properties of the graph structure directly in the prompt (Baek et al., 2023; He et al., 2024; Zhang, 2023) or as factual grounding for generated outputs (Kang et al., 2023; Ranade and Joshi, 2023). Other techniques (Wang et al., 2023b) use the knowledge graph to enhance retrieval, where at query time an LLM-based agent dynamically traverses a graph with nodes representing document elements (e.g., passages, tables) and edges encoding lexical and semantical similarity or structural relationships. GraphRAG contrasts with these approaches by focusing on a previously unexplored quality of graphs in this context: their inherent modularity (Newman, 2006) and the ability to partition graphs into nested modular communities of closely related nodes (e.g., Louvain, Blondel et al. 2008; Leiden, Traag et al. 2019). Specifically, GraphRAG recursively creates increasingly global summaries by using the LLM to create summaries spanning this community hierarchy.

## 2.3 Adaptive benchmarking for RAG Evaluation

Many benchmark datasets for open-domain question answering exist, including HotPotQA (Yang et al., 2018), MultiHop-RAG (Tang and Yang, 2024), and MT-Bench (Zheng et al., 2024). However, these benchmarks are oriented towards vector RAG performance, i.e., they evaluate performance on explicit fact retrieval. In this work, we propose an approach for generating a set of questions for evaluating global sensemaking over the entirety of the corpus. Our approach is related to LLM methods that use a corpus to generate questions whose answers would be summaries of the corpus, such as in Xu and Lapata (2021). However, in order to produce a fair evaluation, our method avoids generating the questions directly from the corpus itself (as an alternative implementation, one can use a subset of the corpus held out from subsequent graph extraction and answer evaluation steps).

Adaptive benchmarking refers to the process of dynamically generating evaluation benchmarks tailored to specific domains or use cases. Recent work has used LLMs for adaptive benchmarking to ensure relevance, diversity, and alignment with the target application or task (Yuan et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2024b). In this work, we propose an adaptive benchmarking approach to generating global sensemaking queries for the LLM. Our approach builds on prior work in LLM-based persona generation, where the LLM is used to generate diverse and authentic sets of personas (Kosinski, 2024; Salminen et al., 2024; Shin et al., 2024). Our adaptive benchmarking procedure uses persona generation to create queries that are representative of real-world RAG system usage. Specifically, our approach uses the LLM to infer the potential users would use the RAG system and their use cases, which guide the generation of corpus-specific sensemaking queries.

## 2.4 RAG evaluation criteria

Our evaluation relies on the LLM to evaluate how well the RAG system answers the generated questions. Prior work has shown LLMs to be good evaluators of natural language generation, including work where LLMs evaluations were competitive with human evaluations (Wang et al., 2023a; Zheng et al., 2024). Some prior work proposes criteria for having LLMs quantify the quality of generated texts such as 'fluency' (Wang et al., 2023a) Some of these criteria are generic to vector RAG systems and not relevant to global sensemaking, such as 'context relevance', 'faithfulness', and 'answer relevance' (RAGAS, Es et al. 2023). Lacking a gold standard for evaluation, one can quantify relative performance for a given criterion by prompting the LLM to compare generations from two different competing models (LLM-as-a-judge, (Zheng et al., 2024)). In this work, we design criteria for evaluating RAG-generated answers to global sensemaking questions and evaluate our results using the comparative approach. We also validate results using statistics derived from LLM-extracted statements of verifiable facts, or 'claims.'

Figure 1: Graph RAG pipeline using an LLM-derived graph index of source document text. This graph index spans nodes (e.g., entities), edges (e.g., relationships), and covariates (e.g., claims) that have been detected, extracted, and summarized by LLM prompts tailored to the domain of the dataset. Community detection (e.g., Leiden, Traag et al., 2019) is used to partition the graph index into groups of elements (nodes, edges, covariates) that the LLM can summarize in parallel at both indexing time and query time. The 'global answer' to a given query is produced using a final round of query-focused summarization over all community summaries reporting relevance to that query.

## 3 Methods

## 3.1 GraphRAG Workflow

Figure 1 illustrates the high-level data flow of the GraphRAG approach and pipeline. In this section, we describe the key design parameters, techniques, and implementation details for each step.

## 3.1.1 Source Documents → Text Chunks

To start, the documents in the corpus are split into text chunks. The LLM extracts information from each chunk for downstream processing. Selecting the size of the chunk is a fundamental design decision; longer text chunks require fewer LLM calls for such extraction (which reduces cost) but suffer from degraded recall of information that appears early in the chunk (Kuratov et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2023). See Section A.1 for prompts and examples of the recall-precision trade-offs.

## 3.1.2 Text Chunks → Entities &amp; Relationships

In this step, the LLM is prompted to extract instances of important entities and the relationships between the entities from a given chunk. Additionally, the LLM generates short descriptions for the entities and relationships. To illustrate, suppose a chunk contained the following text:

NeoChip's (NC) shares surged in their first week of trading on the NewTech Exchange. However, market analysts caution that the chipmaker's public debut may not reflect trends for other technology IPOs. NeoChip, previously a private entity, was acquired by Quantum Systems in 2016. The innovative semiconductor firm specializes in low-power processors for wearables and IoT devices.

The LLM is prompted such that it extracts the following:

- The entity NeoChip , with description 'NeoChip is a publicly traded company specializing in low-power processors for wearables and IoT devices.'
- The entity Quantum Systems , with description 'Quantum Systems is a firm that previously owned NeoChip.'
- Arelationship between NeoChip and Quantum Systems , with description 'Quantum Systems owned NeoChip from 2016 until NeoChip became publicly traded.'

These prompts can be tailored to the domain of the document corpus by choosing domain appropriate few-shot exemplars for in-context learning (Brown et al., 2020). For example, while our default prompt extracts the broad class of 'named entities' like people, places, and organizations and is generally applicable, domains with specialized knowledge (e.g., science, medicine, law) will benefit from few-shot exemplars specialized to those domains.

The LLM can also be prompted to extract claims about detected entities. Claims are important factual statements about entities, such as dates, events, and interactions with other entities. As with entities and relationships, in-context learning exemplars can provide domain-specific guidance. Claim descriptions extracted from the example tetx chunk are as follows:

- NeoChip's shares surged during their first week of trading on the NewTech Exchange.
- NeoChip debuted as a publicly listed company on the NewTech Exchange.
- Quantum Systems acquired NeoChip in 2016 and held ownership until NeoChip went public.

See Appendix A for prompts and details on our implementation of entity and claim extraction.

## 3.1.3 Entities &amp; Relationships → Knowledge Graph

The use of an LLM to extract entities, relationships, and claims is a form of abstractive summarization - these are meaningful summaries of concepts that, in the case of relationships and claims, may not be explicitly stated in the text. The entity/relationship/claim extraction processes creates multiple instances of a single element because an element is typically detected and extracted multiple times across documents.

In the final step of the knowledge graph extraction process, these instances of entities and relationships become individual nodes and edges in the graph. Entity descriptions are aggregated and summarized for each node and edge. Relationships are aggregated into graph edges, where the number of duplicates for a given relationship becomes edge weights. Claims are aggregated similarly.

In this manuscript, our analysis uses exact string matching for entity matching - the task of reconciling different extracted names for the same entity (Barlaug and Gulla, 2021; Christen and Christen, 2012; Elmagarmid et al., 2006). However, softer matching approaches can be used with minor adjustments to prompts or code. Furthermore, GraphRAG is generally resilient to duplicate entities since duplicates are typically clustered together for summarization in subsequent steps.

## 3.1.4 Knowledge Graph → Graph Communities

Given the graph index created in the previous step, a variety of community detection algorithms may be used to partition the graph into communities of strongly connected nodes (e.g., see the surveys by Fortunato (2010) and Jin et al. (2021)). In our pipeline, we use Leiden community detection (Traag et al., 2019) in a hierarchical manner, recursively detecting sub-communities within each detected community until reaching leaf communities that can no longer be partitioned.

Each level of this hierarchy provides a community partition that covers the nodes of the graph in a mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive way, enabling divide-and-conquer global summarization. An illustration of such hierarchical partitioning on an example dataset can be found in Appendix B.

## 3.1.5 Graph Communities → Community Summaries

The next step creates report-like summaries of each community in the community hierarchy, using a method designed to scale to very large datasets. These summaries are independently useful as a way to understand the global structure and semantics of the dataset, and may themselves be used to make sense of a corpus in the absence of a specific query. For example, a user may scan through community summaries at one level looking for general themes of interest, then read linked reports at a lower level that provide additional details for each subtopic. Here, however, we focus on their utility as part of a graph-based index used for answering global queries.

GraphRAG generates community summaries by adding various element summaries (for nodes, edges, and related claims) to a community summary template. Community summaries from lowerlevel communities are used to generate summaries for higher-level communities as follows:

- Leaf-level communities . The element summaries of a leaf-level community are prioritized and then iteratively added to the LLM context window until the token limit is reached. The prioritization is as follows: for each community edge in decreasing order of combined source and target node degree (i.e., overall prominence), add descriptions of the source node, target node, the edge itself, and related claims.
- Higher-level communities . If all element summaries fit within the token limit of the context window, proceed as for leaf-level communities and summarize all element summaries within the community. Otherwise, rank sub-communities in decreasing order of element summary tokens and iteratively substitute sub-community summaries (shorter) for their associated element summaries (longer) until they fit within the context window.

## 3.1.6 Community Summaries → Community Answers → Global Answer

Given a user query, the community summaries generated in the previous step can be used to generate a final answer in a multi-stage process. The hierarchical nature of the community structure also means that questions can be answered using the community summaries from different levels, raising the question of whether a particular level in the hierarchical community structure offers the best balance of summary detail and scope for general sensemaking questions (evaluated in section 4).

For a given community level, the global answer to any user query is generated as follows:

- Prepare community summaries . Community summaries are randomly shuffled and divided into chunks of pre-specified token size. This ensures relevant information is distributed across chunks, rather than concentrated (and potentially lost) in a single context window.
- Map community answers . Intermediate answers are generated in parallel. The LLM is also asked to generate a score between 0-100 indicating how helpful the generated answer is in answering the target question. Answers with score 0 are filtered out.
- Reduce to global answer . Intermediate community answers are sorted in descending order of helpfulness score and iteratively added into a new context window until the token limit is reached. This final context is used to generate the global answer returned to the user.

## 3.2 Global Sensemaking Question Generation

To evaluate the effectiveness of RAG systems for global sensemaking tasks, we use an LLM to generate a set of corpus-specific questions designed to asses high-level understanding of a given corpus, without requiring retrieval of specific low-level facts. Instead, given a high-level description of a corpus and its purposes, the LLM is prompted to generate personas of hypothetical users of the RAG system. For each hypothetical user, the LLM is then prompted to specify tasks that this user would use the RAG system to complete. Finally, for each combination of user and task, the LLM is prompted to generate questions that require understanding of the entire corpus. Algorithm 1 describes the approach.

## Algorithm 1: Prompting Procedure for Question Generation

- 1: Input: Description of a corpus, number of users K , number of tasks per user N , number of questions per (user, task) combination M .
- 2: Output: Aset of K ∗ N ∗ M high-level questions requiring global understanding of the corpus.
- 3: procedure GENERATEQUESTIONS
- 4: Based on the corpus description, prompt the LLM to:
1. Describe personas of K potential users of the dataset.
2. For each user, identify N tasks relevant to the user.
3. Specific to each user &amp; task pair, generate M high-level questions that:
- Require understanding of the entire corpus.
- Do not require retrieval of specific low-level facts.
- 5: Collect the generated questions to produce K ∗ N ∗ M test questions for the dataset.
- 6: end procedure

For our evaluation, we set K = M = N = 5 for a total of 125 test questions per dataset. Table 1 shows example questions for each of the two evaluation datasets.

## 3.3 Criteria for Evaluating Global Sensemaking

Given the lack of gold standard answers to our activity-based sensemaking questions, we adopt the head-to-head comparison approach using an LLM evaluator that judges relative performance according to specific criteria. We designed three target criteria capturing qualities that are desirable for global sensemaking activities.

Appendix F shows the prompts for our head-to-head measures computed using an LLM evaluator, summarized as:

- Comprehensiveness . How much detail does the answer provide to cover all aspects and details of the question?
- Diversity . Howvaried and rich is the answer in providing different perspectives and insights on the question?
- Empowerment . How well does the answer help the reader understand and make informed judgments about the topic?

Table 1: Examples of potential users, tasks, and questions generated by the LLM based on short descriptions of the target datasets. Questions target global understanding rather than specific details.

How can educators use the dataset to highlight the importance of health literacy?                              |

Furthermore, we use a 'control criterion' called Directness that answers 'How specifically and clearly does the answer address the question?' . In plain terms, directness evaluates the concision of an answer in a generic sense that applies to any generated LLM summarization. We include it to behave as a reference against which we can judge the soundness of results for the other criteria. Since directness is effectively in opposition to comprehensiveness and diversity, we would not expect any method to win across all four criteria.

In our evaluations, the LLM is provided with the question, the generated answers from two competing systems, and prompted to compare the two answers according to the criterion before giving a final judgment of which answer is preferred. The LLM either indicates a winner; or, it returns a tie if they are fundamentally similar. To account for the inherent stochasticity of LLM generation, we run each comparison with multiple replicates and average the results across replicates and questions. An illustration of LLM assessment for answers to a sample question can be found in Appendix D.

## 4 Analysis

## 4.1 Experiment 1

## 4.1.1 Datasets

We selected two datasets in the one million token range, each representative of corpora that users may encounter in their real-world activities:

Podcast transcripts . Public transcripts of Behind the Tech with Kevin Scott , a podcast featuring conversations between Microsoft CTO Kevin Scott and various thought leaders in science and technology (Scott, 2024). This corpus was divided into 1669 × 600-token text chunks, with 100-token overlaps between chunks ( ∼ 1 million tokens).

News articles . A benchmark dataset comprised of news articles published from September 2013 to December 2023 in a range of categories, including entertainment, business, sports, technology, health, and science (Tang and Yang, 2024). The corpus is divided into 3197 × 600-token text chunks, with 100-token overlaps between chunks ( ∼ 1.7 million tokens).

## 4.1.2 Conditions

We compared six conditions including GraphRAG at four different graph community levels ( C0 , C1 , C2 , C3 ), a text summarization method that applies our map-reduce approach directly to source texts ( TS ), and a vector RAG 'semantic search' approach ( SS ):

- CO . Uses root-level community summaries (fewest in number) to answer user queries.
- C1 . Uses high-level community summaries to answer queries. These are sub-communities of C0, if present, otherwise C0 communities projected downwards.
- C2 . Uses intermediate-level community summaries to answer queries. These are subcommunities of C1, if present, otherwise C1 communities projected downwards.
- C3 . Uses low-level community summaries (greatest in number) to answer queries. These are sub-communities of C2, if present, otherwise C2 communities projected downwards.
- TS . The same method as in Section 3.1.6, except source texts (rather than community summaries) are shuffled and chunked for the map-reduce summarization stages.
- SS . An implementation of vector RAG in which text chunks are retrieved and added to the available context window until the specified token limit is reached.

The size of the context window and the prompts used for answer generation are the same across all six conditions (except for minor modifications to reference styles to match the types of context information used). Conditions only differ in how the contents of the context window are created.

The graph index supporting conditions C0 -C3 was created using our generic prompts for entity and relationship extraction, with entity types and few-shot examples tailored to the domain of the data.

## 4.1.3 Configuration

Weused a fixed context window size of 8k tokens for generating community summaries, community answers, and global answers (explained in Appendix C). Graph indexing with a 600 token window (explained in Section A.2) took 281 minutes for the Podcast dataset, running on a virtual machine (16GB RAM, Intel(R) Xeon(R) Platinum 8171M CPU @ 2.60GHz) and using a public OpenAI endpoint for gpt-4-turbo (2M TPM, 10k RPM).

We implemented Leiden community detection using the graspologic library (Chung et al., 2019). The prompts used to generate the graph index and global answers can be found in Appendix E, while the prompts used to evaluate LLM responses against our criteria can be found in Appendix F. A full statistical analysis of the results presented in the next section can be found in Appendix G.

## 4.2 Experiment 2

To validate the comprehensiveness and diversity results from Experiment 1, we implemented claimbased measures of these qualities. We use the definition of a factual claim from Ni et al. (2024), which is 'a statement that explicitly presents some verifiable facts.' For example, the sentence 'California and New York implemented incentives for renewable energy adoption, highlighting the broader importance of sustainability in policy decisions' contains two factual claims: (1) California implemented incentives for renewable energy adoption, and (2) New York implemented incentives for renewable energy adoption.

To extract factual claims, we used Claimify (Metropolitansky and Larson, 2025), an LLM-based method that identifies sentences in an answer containing at least one factual claim, then decomposes these sentences into simple, self-contained factual claims. We applied Claimify to the answers generated under the conditions from Experiment 1. After removing duplicate claims from each answer, we extracted 47,075 unique claims, with an average of 31 claims per answer.

We defined two metrics, with higher values indicating better performance:

1. Comprehensiveness : Measured as the average number of claims extracted from the answers generated under each condition.
2. Diversity : Measured by clustering the claims for each answer and calculating the average number of clusters.

For clustering, we followed the approach described by Padmakumar and He (2024), which involved using Scikit-learn's implementation of agglomerative clustering (Pedregosa et al., 2011). Clusters were merged through 'complete' linkage, meaning they were combined only if the maximum distance between their farthest points was less than or equal to a predefined distance threshold. The distance metric used was 1 -ROUGE-L. Since the distance threshold influences the number of clusters, we report results across a range of thresholds.

## 5 Results

## 5.1 Experiment 1

The indexing process resulted in a graph consisting of 8,564 nodes and 20,691 edges for the Podcast dataset, and a larger graph of 15,754 nodes and 19,520 edges for the News dataset. Table 2 shows the number of community summaries at different levels of each graph community hierarchy.

Global approaches vs. vector RAG . As shown in Figure 2 and Table 6, global approaches significantly outperformed conventional vector RAG ( SS ) in both comprehensiveness and diversity criteria across datasets. Specifically, global approaches achieved comprehensiveness win rates between 7283% (p &lt; .001) for Podcast transcripts and 72-80% (p &lt; .001) for News articles, while diversity win rates ranged from 75-82% (p &lt; .001) and 62-71% (p &lt; .01) respectively. Our use of directness as a validity test confirmed that vector RAG produces the most direct responses across all comparisons.

Empowerment . Empowerment comparisons showed mixed results for both global approaches versus vector RAG ( SS ) and GraphRAG approaches versus source text summarization ( TS ). Using an LLM to analyze LLM reasoning for this measure indicated that the ability to provide specific exam-
